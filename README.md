Indoor Navigation Using Drones: A Real-Time Systems  Approach        

Background and description of our project:
Real-time systems are designed to respond to input or environmental changes 
within a specific period. In the context of indoor navigation, the need for realtime data processing and response is paramount, especially in dynamic 
environments. This project leverages drone technology to address this need.
Drones, equipped with sensors and cameras, can navigate indoor spaces, 
capturing data points in real-time.
The primary goal of this project is to utilize drone-scanned points to identify 
exits in different rooms.

Problem Definition:
Our primary challenge was to utilize drone-scanned data to identify exits in 
different rooms. 
We were given database of rooms, our goal was to build an algorithm that 
successfully finds for every room its exit.
